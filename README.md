# Welcome! This site is under construction, so I'm trying to use this as a schematic if you wish.
My name is Leon Peter Keates, and I am a 17 year old British college student; soon-to-be a website designer and hoping to learn HTML, CSS, and other languages one day.

# About me
I was born on the 19th of December 2005 in Gosport, Hampshire, UK. I have been living in the UK for all my life, only 7 nights away in Croatia for holiday, and a few days/nights in Wales; one time to see Gojira (a French heavy metal band) and yeah.

Other than that, I am pretty much trying to learn the French language, as well as coding-wise, HTML, CSS and others, but I am trying to find resources to learn. In my free time, I like to play Valorant (yes I know, the Nickelback of FPS games, or CS:GO/Overwatch copies if you may) and sometimes Minecraft, but y'know.

# Skills
I am a/an x in:
Beginner: French language, C++, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Rhythm Guitar
Intermediate: Python, HTML, Bass Guitar (formerly), negotation, English (part Beginner as well)
Expert: Mathematics (sorry, I am not Albert Einstein since my IQ is slightly lower than 160, but my predicted is in the 120s at least), Geography, Research (I love telling facts, but I am sometimes a know-it-all), Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint (the three musketeers of expertise in Microsoft knowledge), Minecraft knowledge
